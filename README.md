# Inquire

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/tmattio/inquire/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tmattio/inquire/actions)

An OCaml library to create beautiful interactive CLIs.

## Installation

### Using Opam

```bash
opam install inquire
```

### Using Esy

```bash
esy add @opam/inquire
```

## Usage

### Confirm

Prompt the user to answer the given message with "y" or "n".

```ocaml
Inquire.confirm "Are you sure?"
```

### Raw List

Prompt the user to chose a value from the given options.

```ocaml
Inquire.raw_select "What's your favorite movie?" ~options:[ "Choice 1" ; "Choice 2" ]
```

### Password

Prompt the user to enter a password that will be hidden with stars (`*`).

```ocaml
Inquire.password "Enter your password:"
```

### Input

Prompt the user to input a string.

```ocaml
Inquire.input "Enter a value:"
```

### Custom Implementation

Create a custom implementation to style Inquire's prompts.

```ocaml
module CustomInquire = Inquire.Make (struct
  open LTerm_style
  open LTerm_text

  let make_prompt message =
    eval
      [ B_fg green; S "? "; B_fg white; S (Printf.sprintf "%s" message); E_fg ]

  let make_error message =
    eval
      [ B_fg green; S "X "; B_fg white; S (Printf.sprintf "%s" message); E_fg ]

  let make_select ~current options =
    List.mapi options ~f:(fun index option ->
        if current = index then
          [ B_fg green
          ; S "> "
          ; B_fg white
          ; S (Printf.sprintf "%s\n" option)
          ; E_fg
          ]
        else
          [ S "  "; B_fg white; S (Printf.sprintf "%s\n" option); E_fg ])
    |> List.concat
    |> eval
end)

let _ =
  let result = CustomInquire.confirm "Are you sure?" ~default:true in
  Lwt_main.run result
```

## Contributing

### Developing

You need Opam, you can install it by following [Opam's documentation](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html).

With Opam installed, you can install the dependencies with:

```bash
opam install --deps-only --with-test -y .
```

Then, build the project with:

```bash
make
```

### Running Examples

After building the project, you can run the example binaries with:

```bash
dune exec example/<example>.exe
```

For instance, to run the `confirm.ml` example, you can type:

```bash
dune exec example/confirm.exe
```

### Building documentation

Documentation for the libraries in the project can be generated with:

```bash
make doc
open-cli $(make doc-path)
```

This assumes you have a command like [open-cli](https://github.com/sindresorhus/open-cli) installed on your system.

> NOTE: On macOS, you can use the system command `open`, for instance `open $(make doc-path)`

### Create new releases

To create a release and publish it on Opam, you can run the script `script/release.sh`. It will create a tag with the version found in `inquire.opam`, and push it on your repository.

From there, the CI/CD will take care of publishing your documentation, create a github release, and open a PR with your version on `opam-repository`.
